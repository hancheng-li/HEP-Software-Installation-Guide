# HEP_Software_Installation_Guide

Hi, my name is Hancheng. I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student studying at UCSB. I'm currently working with Nathaniel Craig, and Jessica Howard as an undergraduate rresearch assistant in the group. Recently, I've came across a project where I need to install some HEP software on my personal computer for simulation. I've been warned that the installation process on Macs will be a hassle but managed to installed all the necessary software within a day. This GitHub repo contains the most updated guide on installing **MadGraph**, **Pythia8**, and **Delphes** on M-series macs with macOS Sonoma. Please see the pdf document or the tex document for detail. Hopefully, this guide will be helpful to you.
